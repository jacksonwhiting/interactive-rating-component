## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I should have used a form element to build this.  It was good to jump back into Javascript and review how to wire up the elements and change the styles.

Perhaps there's a better way to show the thank you page besides hiding it and then displaying it?  I'll continue to research.
